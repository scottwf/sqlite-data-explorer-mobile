## Running the Dev Server on Boot (Linux/systemd)

To automatically start the Vite dev server when your server boots, use systemd:

1. **Create a systemd service file:**
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/sqlite-data-explorer.service
   ```
   Paste the following (edit paths and user as needed):
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=SQLite Data Explorer Vite Dev Server
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=scott
   WorkingDirectory=/home/scott/sqlite-data-explorer-mobile
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm run dev
   Restart=always
   Environment=PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
   Environment=NODE_ENV=development

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

2. **Reload systemd and enable the service:**
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable sqlite-data-explorer
   sudo systemctl start sqlite-data-explorer
   ```

3. **Check status and logs:**
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl status sqlite-data-explorer
   journalctl -u sqlite-data-explorer -f
   ```

This will keep your dev server running in the background and restart it if it crashes. For production, consider building and serving static files with a production server.
